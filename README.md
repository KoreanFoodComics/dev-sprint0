Week 0: Boston StartUp School's Dev RampUp

This is the repo that students will fork and submit the sprint to.

Credits to Allen Downey for the Swampy Module and Think Python. Swampy can be found at http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkpython/swampy/. We copied it to this github so that it is easier for Boston Startup School RampUp students to access without installation.
